# ResponseBuilder

`ResponseBuilder` is a utility class designed to construct consistent and structured API response objects. It allows chaining methods to set metadata like transaction IDs, messages, and data payloads before building the final response object.

---

## Features

- Set a **transaction ID** for request tracing.
- Add a **message** to describe the response status or outcome.
- Include **data** in the response body.
- Build a structured response object for API endpoints.

---

## Installation

Include `ResponseBuilder` in your Node.js project by requiring the module:

```javascript
const ResponseBuilder = require('./ResponseBuilder');
```

---

## Response Structure

The response object generated by `ResponseBuilder` has the following structure:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "transactionId": "string",
    "message": "string"
  },
  "data": "any"
}
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Building a Basic Response
```javascript
const ResponseBuilder = require('./ResponseBuilder');

const response = new ResponseBuilder()
    .setTransactionId('abc123')
    .setMessage('Request processed successfully')
    .build();

console.log(response);
```

### Including Data in the Response
```javascript
const ResponseBuilder = require('./ResponseBuilder');

const response = new ResponseBuilder()
    .setTransactionId('abc123')
    .setMessage('User data retrieved successfully')
    .setData({ userId: 1, name: 'Jane Doe' })
    .build();

console.log(response);
```

---

## Best Practices

- Use `ResponseBuilder` in your API controllers or service layers to standardize API responses.
- Always set a transaction ID for easier debugging and tracing of requests.
- Avoid including sensitive data in the response's `data` field.
